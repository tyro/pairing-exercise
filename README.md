# Pairing Exercise

In the Tyro pairing interview, you will be provided with a coding challenge and paired with a member of our engineering
team to solve it. This exercise will give you a chance to experience some of the practices we use here at Tyro (i.e.,
pair programming, TDD). While also allowing us to see how you code and interact with a pair.

This project serves as an example of what we expect you to have prepared for the interview. It contains a failing test,
written in your choice of Java or Kotlin, and some commonly used dependencies. Feel free not to use it and create your
own if you prefer. You may also include whatever libraries and tools you are most comfortable developing with (e.g.,
Lombok, Gradle).
